TP is a one-stop-shop for jobs and skills focusing on Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs), career switchers, students and fresh graduates to meet their talent-related needs. It is a partnership involving government agencies, labour movement, institutes of higher learning and industry collaborating to reimagine and redefine the future of work in the growing Technology space.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur corporate partners include Grab, Seedly, the Fifth Person and Endowus. Collaborating from the public sector, Mr. Patrick Tay (Assistant Secretary General of NTUC) connected us to the chairman of the hawkers association, Mr. Anthony. He welcomed our efforts in the community outreach programme during which our volunteers approached the general public and had informal coffee chats at hawker centres about FinTech. By walking the ground in the heartlands of Boon Lay, Tiong Bahru, Ghim Moh, Clementi, Ang Mo Kio and Bedok, we were able to obtain valuable feedback on the public\u2019s perceptions towards FinTech which could help inform our approach towards tailoring our programmes to suit the public\u2019s needs. Additionally, this community outreach allowed us to drive interest in the Singapore FinTech Festival\u2019s Talent Pavilion event. Within a week of launch, due to our publicity efforts, we were able to drive 34,000 visitors to the talent pavilion website (www.talentpavilion.sg)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FinTech Society was actively involved in planning and execution of the FinTech Literacy in Heartlands programme and the Round Table Discussions from 7 December, 2020 to 10th December 2020 as part of Talent Pavilion and SFF 2020. Our society is proud to have been able to collaborate with the Monetary Authority of Singapore for the third time this year.","department":1},{"id":12,"imageUrls":[{"id":22,"url":"https://i.imgur.com/6Pj0nda.jpg","project":12},{"id":23,"url":"https://i.imgur.com/Nyth7Cx.jpg","project":12},{"id":24,"url":"https://i.imgur.com/yEMtjAQ.jpg","project":12},{"id":25,"url":"https://i.imgur.com/8OX3iwh.jpg","project":12},{"id":26,"url":"https://i.imgur.com/JXs0lg3.jpg","project":12},{"id":27,"url":"https://i.imgur.com/SY14G9L.jpg","project":12},{"id":28,"url":"https://i.imgur.com/ESZQXLG.jpg","project":12},{"id":29,"url":"https://i.imgur.com/AvJ4JoB.jpg","project":12}],"title":"NUS FinTech Month","details":"FinTech Month is a series of workshops and hackathon designed to give tertiary students an insight into the world of FinTech.

This project demonstrates how adversarial techniques can be used to sabotage otherwise high performing credit risk models.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team was able to demonstrate that an Artificial Neural Network trained with over 99% accuracy in detecting credit fraud could be attacked to the level of having less than 11% accuracy.","department":2},{"id":6,"imageUrls":[{"id":18,"url":"https://cdn.i.haymarketmedia.asia/?n=corporate-treasurer%2Fcontent%2FDigital+brain.jpg&h=270&w=405&q=100&v=20150902&c=1","project":6}],"title":"Collaboration with BNP Paribas Corporate Treasury","details":"BNP Paribas is a French Multinational Bank that offers clients solutions for capital markets, securities services, financing, treasury and financial advisory.
